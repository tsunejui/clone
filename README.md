# Clone (I'm too lazy to live, so I wrote an AI to do it for me)

> 我太懶了，所以寫個 AI 幫我活著

Welcome to the **Life Outsourcing Project**. This is a personal AI agent designed to act as your digital twin, specifically engineered for people who find the daily requirements of "being a person" to be a bit much. 

Why live your own life when you can automate it?

## Why Clone?

Life is full of high-latency, low-reward tasks. Clone fixes this by automating your existence:
- **Digital Twin:** Combines your past life experiences into persistent memory so the AI can mimic your specific brand of sarcasm.
- **Social Ghostwriting:** Integrates with your social accounts to like, post, and pretend you're socially active while you're actually staring at a wall.
- **Knowledge Shortcuts:** Why read when the AI can summarize everything? Stay "informed" with zero effort.
- **Everyday Evasion:** Handles the mundane tasks that keep you from your true calling: doing absolutely nothing.

## Project Structure (Optimized for Laziness)

```text
.claude/      # Where the AI's soul (and config) lives
docs/         # For people who aren't yet too lazy to read
justfiles/    # Shortcuts for shortcuts
scripts/      # The "do-it-for-me" automation scripts
Justfile      # The big 'Easy' button
mise.toml     # Set up your environment so you don't have to
```

## Quick Start (If you can handle 3 steps)

If following these instructions feels like too much work, you might be our target audience:

1. Install `mise` (do it once, cry never).
2. Run `just setup` (one command to rule them all).
3. Lie down. The AI will take it from here.
